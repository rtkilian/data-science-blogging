# Data Science Blogging
This repository contains a series of Jupter Notebooks of blog posts I have written.

**[Build Complex Time Series Regression Pipelines with sktime](https://towardsdatascience.com/build-complex-time-series-regression-pipelines-with-sktime-910bc25c96b6)** - *Towards Data Science*

This tutorial discusses how you can convert a time series forecasting problem to a regression problem using sktime. I will also show you how to build a complex time series forecaster with the popular library, XGBoost. [Code](https://github.com/rtkilian/data-science-blogging/blob/main/sktime_regression_forecasting.ipynb).

**[Anonymise Sensitive Data in a Pandas DataFrame Column with hashlib](https://towardsdatascience.com/anonymise-sensitive-data-in-a-pandas-dataframe-column-with-hashlib-8e7ef397d91f)** - *Towards Data Science*

After completing this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of what a hash algorithm is. We see how to use hashlib to hash a single string and how this can be applied to a pandas DataFrame column to anonymise sensitive information. [Code](https://github.com/rtkilian/data-science-blogging/blob/main/hashlib_pandas.ipynb).

**[How I Deployed a Sentiment Analyser API with spaCy, Flask and Heroku](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-deployed-a-sentiment-analyser-api-with-spacy-flask-and-heroku-bd9b8f9de6cf#e944-29fa8eb0b743)** - *Towards Data Science*

By completing this tutorial, you will learn to deploy a machine learning model to Heroku using Flask. Therefore, even if you donâ€™t have access to Machine Learning Engineers or Software Engineers at your organisation, you will have the necessary skills to deploy machine learning REST APIs.

**[What Hypothesis Test Should I Use for My A/B Experiment?](https://towardsdatascience.com/what-hypothesis-test-should-i-use-for-my-a-b-experiment-2cfc7fd3537b)** - *Towards Data Science*

This article reviews the hypothesis tests you will most likely use when analysing your A/B experiments. We cover what situations the tests are most suitable for, what assumptions need to be met, how to interpret the results, and provided the code and resources you will need to implement the tests.
