**[Anonymise Sensitive Data in a Pandas DataFrame Column with hashlib](https://towardsdatascience.com/anonymise-sensitive-data-in-a-pandas-dataframe-column-with-hashlib-8e7ef397d91f)** - *Towards Data Science*

After completing this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of what a hash algorithm is. We see how to use hashlib to hash a single string and how this can be applied to a pandas DataFrame column to anonymise sensitive information. [Code](https://github.com/rtkilian/data-science-blogging/blob/main/hashlib_pandas.ipynb).
