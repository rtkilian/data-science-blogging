# Data Science Blogging
This repository contains a series of Jupter Notebooks of blog posts I have written.

**[Anonymise Sensitive Data in a Pandas DataFrame Column with hashlib](https://towardsdatascience.com/anonymise-sensitive-data-in-a-pandas-dataframe-column-with-hashlib-8e7ef397d91f)** - *Towards Data Science*

After completing this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of what a hash algorithm is. We see how to use hashlib to hash a single string and how this can be applied to a pandas DataFrame column to anonymise sensitive information. [Code](https://github.com/rtkilian/data-science-blogging/blob/main/hashlib_pandas.ipynb).

**[How I Deployed a Sentiment Analyser API with spaCy, Flask and Heroku](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-i-deployed-a-sentiment-analyser-api-with-spacy-flask-and-heroku-bd9b8f9de6cf#e944-29fa8eb0b743)** - *Towards Data Science*

By completing this tutorial, you will learn to deploy a machine learning model to Heroku using Flask. Therefore, even if you donâ€™t have access to Machine Learning Engineers or Software Engineers at your organisation, you will have the necessary skills to deploy machine learning REST APIs.
