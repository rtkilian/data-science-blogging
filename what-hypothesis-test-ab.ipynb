    "The choice of hypothesis test after running an A/B test can be overwhelming for any data practicioner. The popular Python libraries, [scipy](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#statistical-tests) and [statsmodels](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#statistical-tests), have implemented hundreds of hypothesis tests for all types of use cases. \n",
    "\n",
    "This article is written to be your quick reference guide to the most common types of hypothesis tests you'll need to analyse your A/B(/C) experiments. I use these tests regularly in my role as a Data Scientist at [Movember](http://movember.com/). \n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover parametric and non-parametric tests for continuous and categorical variables in two or more samples. Each test will include a brief description, the assumptions, how the hypotheses are formulated and sample Python code. You are encouraged to read the documentation when you are implementing the test as each method has several different input parameters. \n",
